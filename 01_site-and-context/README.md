# 01 – Site & Context

This project uses my own public test shop **Siete Padel** at `siete.ch`.

This store is intentionally **not a commercial product**, but a fully accessible technical playground:

- WordPress with Astra theme  
- WooCommerce as the e-commerce engine  
- Custom, simple page structure (Homepage, Categories, Products, Checkout)  
- Design is functional rather than polished  
- Strong focus on measurability and technical transparency

I use this shop as a **real-world sandbox** to gain hands-on experience in:

- Clean client-side tracking using Google Tag Manager and GA4  
- Event-based e-commerce tracking (WooCommerce + GTM4WP)  
- Building an end-to-end analytics pipeline  
- Exporting and processing event data via GA4 Data API and Python  

Scope clarification:

- **No active marketing or sales goals**
- **No personal data** stored or published in this repository  
- This is a **learning environment** focused on measurement and data engineering
